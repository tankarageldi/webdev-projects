      <h2 id="question1"> #1) Merge Strings Alternately</h2>
      <p>We are given two strings, word1 and word2. Question wants us to merge this two Strings, 
        by adding letters in alternating order, starting from word1. And if a string is longer than the other, we need to append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

        So, since two strings most likely going to be different length, lets say n,m for lengths of word1, word2.
        For this solution, I used the two pointer technique. We need to use two pointers, one for each string, and iterate through the strings,adding characters one by one to the result string.

        Here is the <strong>algorithm</strong> for the solution: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            initialize i,j = 0
          </li>
          <li>
            initialize an empty string, for appending the result. 
          </li>
          <li>
            iterate through the array while pointer i's value is less than word1's length, or pointer j's value is less than word2's length.
            <ul>
              <li>
                if the pointer i's value is less than word1's length, means we still have at least one character we didnt go through in the string.
                append that character to the string, and increase i's value by one. 
              </li>
              <li>
                if the pointer j's value is less than word2's length, append the character pointer j is pointing, increase j's value by one. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
             return the result string 
            </li>
          </li>
        </ul>

        By this loop and conditions, we ensure that if any of word1 or word2 has smaller length than the other one, after all of its characters are iterated and appended to the result, rest of the longer string's characters will be appended. 
        And since we're only looping through two arrays length n and m, space complexity will be <strong>O(m+n).</strong> And space complexity is <strong>O(1).</strong>

      <h2 id="question6 ">#6) Reverse Words in String</h2>
      <p> For this question, my first intuition was converting the string into a list by splitting the words by empty spaces after them. Python has a function for this, which is split() function.
        After the spliting the string to a list, we are going to iterate the list in <strong>reverse</strong> order. And while iterating in reverse order, we need to make sure that spaces between words are correctly appended too. For this, we will <strong>not</strong>
        append the first word in the original list. Here is the algorithm : 
        <ul>
          <li>
            split the string into a list.
          </li>
          <li>
            create a variable, for appending words. 
          </li>
          <li>
            iterate through the list, in reverse order, but without the first element of the original list.
            <ul><li>
              append the first element in reverse list to the result string, also append a " " character. 
            </li></ul>
          </li>
          <li>get the last word to append to the list, which is the first element of the initial list. append it to the result</li>
          <li>return the result</li>
        </ul>
