      <h2 id="question1"> #1) Merge Strings Alternately</h2>
      <p>We are given two strings, word1 and word2. Question wants us to merge this two Strings, 
        by adding letters in alternating order, starting from word1. And if a string is longer than the other, we need to append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

        So, since two strings most likely going to be different length, lets say n,m for lengths of word1, word2.
        For this solution, I used the two pointer technique. We need to use two pointers, one for each string, and iterate through the strings,adding characters one by one to the result string.

        Here is the <strong>algorithm</strong> for the solution: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            initialize i,j = 0
          </li>
          <li>
            initialize an empty string, for appending the result. 
          </li>
          <li>
            iterate through the array while pointer i's value is less than word1's length, or pointer j's value is less than word2's length.
            <ul>
              <li>
                if the pointer i's value is less than word1's length, means we still have at least one character we didnt go through in the string.
                append that character to the string, and increase i's value by one. 
              </li>
              <li>
                if the pointer j's value is less than word2's length, append the character pointer j is pointing, increase j's value by one. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
             return the result string 
            </li>
          </li>
        </ul>

        By this loop and conditions, we ensure that if any of word1 or word2 has smaller length than the other one, after all of its characters are iterated and appended to the result, rest of the longer string's characters will be appended. 
        And since we're only looping through two arrays length n and m, space complexity will be <strong>O(m+n).</strong> And space complexity is <strong>O(1).</strong>

        j = 0
        result = []
        
        while i < m or j < n:
            if i < m:
                result += word1[i]
                i += 1
            if j < n:
                result += word2[j]
                j += 1
        
        return "".join(result)

      <h2 id="question2">#2) Greatest Common Divisor of Strings </h2>
      <p>
        for this question,For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if t is concatenated with itself one or more times. So my approach was, if there is a greatest common divisor, then combining that greatest common divisor 1 or more times with itself will give s, and t. So if there is a greatest common divisor, the result of combining t and s, will be some type of multiplication of the gcd. By this logic, to check if there is a gcd, we can just check if the strings combined from both sides are equal. If they are not, there is no gcd, so we can just return an empty string. 
        If they are equal, we can go on and calculate the gcd of the <strong>lengths of the strings</strong>, which will give us the largest common divisor length inside the string, lets say m . Now we just have to return the first m letters of any of them word1 or word2. Here is the algorithm : 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Check if str1 + str2 is not equal to str2 + str1
            <ul>
              <li>if true, return empty string since there is no greatest common divisor of these two strings.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Else, calculate the greatest commmon divisor between str1 and str2's lengths, assign it to a variable "n". 
          </li>
          <li>
            return the first <strong>n</strong> characters in any string.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

          <code>
class Solution:
    def gcdOfStrings(self, str1: str, str2: str)
        if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:
            return ""
                
        max_length = gcd(len(str1),len(str2))
        return str1[:max_length]

      <h2 id="question6">#6) Reverse Words in String</h2>
      <p> For this question, my first intuition was converting the string into a list by splitting the words by empty spaces after them. Python has a function for this, which is split() function.
        After the spliting the string to a list, we are going to iterate the list in <strong>reverse</strong> order. And while iterating in reverse order, we need to make sure that spaces between words are correctly appended too. For this, we will <strong>not</strong>
        append the first word in the original list. Here is the algorithm : 
        <ul>
          <li>
            split the string into a list.
          </li>
          <li>
            create a variable, for appending words. 
          </li>
          <li>
            iterate through the list, in reverse order, but without the first element of the original list.
            <ul><li>
              append the first element in reverse list to the result string, also append a " " character. 
            </li></ul>
          </li>
          <li>get the last word to append to the list, which is the first element of the initial list. append it to the result</li>
          <li>return the result</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <div class="code-container">
        <pre>
          <code>
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = ""
        list_words = s.split()
        for item in reversed(list_words[1:]):
            res += item + " "
        last = list_words[0]
        res += last
        return res

        <h2 id="question7">#7) Product of Array Except Self</h2>
        <p> For this question, my first approach was to calculate the product of all elements, and divide each while iterating through the array, but in the description division is not allowed to use. Also they want us to do this question in O(n) time, with O(1) space, not counting the output array. 
          So, second approach was to calculate the left product of each element, and calculate the right product of each element. To do this, we can create two lists, left and right.
          left list is for keeping track of the left products of each element in nums, and right list is for keeping track of right products of each element in nums, and the answer will be the product of left and right. 
          This way, we find an easy solution with O(n) time, but space complexity is greater than O(1), since we need to have three arrays, left,right,and output. To reduce the complexity, instead of having the right list, we can only calculate the left list, and multiply the corresponding right product value, which we can keep in an integer. And this left list, by this method, turns into the output list, so we dont need that one anymore either. 
          Here is the algorithm for this solution: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              get the lenght of nums, store it in "n"
            </li>
            <li>
              create the output list, same length as nums list
            </li>
            <li>
              append 1, to the first index of the list. Regardless what element is in the first index, 1 will always be its left product.
            </li>
            <li>
              create a variable, called right, and assign 1, for keeping track of the right product of each index
            </li>
            <li>
              loop from index i = 1 to the end of the nums 
              <ul>
                calculate the product of nums[i-1] and output[i-1], and assign it to output[i]
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              loop from index i = length - 1 to 0
              <ul>
                <li>
                  multiply nums[i] and r values, and assign it to r 
                </li>
                <li>
                  calculate the product of output[i-1] and r,assign it to output[i-1]
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              return output
            </li>
          </ul>
          O(n) time complexity, O(1) space complexity, when output array space does not count.

          <h2>07/18/2024) 1380. Lucky Numbers in Matrix</h2>
          <p>Problem : Given an m x n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

            A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.
            <br>
            <br>This is a matrix question. Since the question explains the lucky number is the <strong>minimum element in its row</strong> and <strong>maximum element in its column</strong>. 
            So my first thought was to find the <strong>minimum element in each row</strong> and put it inside a list. 
            after this is done, we need to find the maximum element in each column, but columns are not as easy to access as rows.To get the max of each column, I constructed a nested for loop, to go through the every i'th element of each row, and append those elements into a dummy list, to basically construct a column list. After first column is constructed inside the list, I calculate the maximum value inside the dummy list, and append this value to another list for keeping track of maximum values in each column, then clear the dummy list to use it again for the next column. After our nested for loop is done, we have two lists, one contains the minimum elements in each row, and other one contains the maximum elements in each column. now go through both of the lists again to find all common numbers, which are going to be our answers. I appended these numbers into the dummy list i used earlier because it was empty,since i clear the array after each use.
            Here is the algorithm : 
            <ul><li>
              create three lists, min_row for collecting the minimum value in each row, max_col for collecting the maximum value in each column, dummy for a helper list.
            </li>
            <li>
              for each row in the matrix, append the minimum value in the row to the min_row list.
            </li>
            <li>
              loop from i = 0 until m, where m is length of each row. 
              <ul><li>loop from j = 0 until n, where n is length of each column</li>
              <ul><li>append the j'th rows i'th column to the dummy list</li></ul>
              <li>append the maximum value in the dummy list to the max_col list.</li> 
            </li>
            <li>clear the dummy list</li>  
            </ul>
            <li>go through each element1 in min_row</li>
            <ul><li>go through each element2 in max_col</li>
              <li>if element1 is equal to element 2, append the value to the dummy list</li>
            </ul>
            <li>return dummy list</li>
            </ul>
